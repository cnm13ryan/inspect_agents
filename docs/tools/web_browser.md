# web_browser_*

## Overview
- Family of navigation/interaction tools backed by a persistent browser/context session.
- Tools include: `web_browser_go`, `web_browser_click`, `web_browser_type_submit`, `web_browser_scroll`, `web_browser_back`, `web_browser_forward`, `web_browser_refresh`.
- Classification: stateful (session id created on first use; reused across calls).

## Parameters
- session_id: string — Optional; if absent, a new session is created.
- action-specific fields — e.g., url, selector, text, delta.

## Result Schema
- snapshot: object — Page state/DOM excerpt/screenshot ref (provider-dependent).
- events: list[object] — Actions performed and outcomes.
- errors: list[str]

## Timeouts & Limits
- Defaults are defined by Inspect’s standard web browser tools; this repo does not override them. See Inspect documentation for authoritative navigation/interaction timeouts, session handling, and parallelism.

## Enablement
- Disabled by default. Set `INSPECT_ENABLE_WEB_BROWSER=1` to enable the browser tool family.
- Requires a sandbox environment. For a ready Playwright setup via Docker, see: ../how-to/sandboxing_inspect_agents.md

## Examples
```
Open a page, click a link, capture content.
```

## Safety & Best Practices
- Avoid navigating to untrusted pages; respect robots and auth requirements.

## Troubleshooting
- Stale session — Retry with a new session_id or use restart action if available.
