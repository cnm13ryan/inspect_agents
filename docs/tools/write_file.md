# write_file

!!! warning "Deprecated — use files tool"
    This wrapper is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use the unified [files](files.md) tool with `{ command: "write" }`.

    - Migration: `write_file({file_path, content, instance})` → `files({ params: { command: "write", file_path, content, instance } })`
    - Full guide: see [Deprecations & Migrations](deprecations.md) for a one‑page before/after table.
    - Warnings: executing this wrapper emits a `DeprecationWarning` (visible when `PYTHONWARNINGS=default`).
    - CI noise control: set `INSPECT_AGENTS_SUPPRESS_TOOL_WRAPPER_WARN=1` to suppress the warning in automated runs.

## Overview
- Creates or overwrites a file’s contents with a bounded timeout.
- Classification: stateless.

## Parameters
- file_path: string — Destination path. Required.
- content: string — File body. Required.
- instance: string — Optional `Files` instance name for isolation.

## Result Schema
- Default: string — Summary message (e.g., “Updated file <path>”).
- Typed (when `INSPECT_AGENTS_TYPED_RESULTS=1`): `{ path: string, summary: string }` (`FileWriteResult`).

## Timeouts & Limits
- Execution timeout: 15s; no explicit size cap in store mode; sandbox editor may impose its own; no newline normalization.

## Sandbox Notes
- When `INSPECT_AGENTS_FS_MODE=sandbox` and sandbox is available, routes to `text_editor('create', path, file_text=...)`. On sandbox failure, falls back to the in‑memory store.
- Delete operations are disabled in sandbox mode (separate `delete_file` tool is store‑only).

## Examples
### Typed vs Legacy (quick look)

Args
```json
{"file_path": "docs/note.md", "content": "Hello"}
```

Typed
```json
{ "path": "docs/note.md", "summary": "Updated file docs/note.md" }
```

Legacy
```
Updated file docs/note.md
```

## Safety & Best Practices
- Avoid large binary blobs; prefer small, textual diffs.

## Troubleshooting
- Permission denied or sandbox errors — Ensure sandbox is available or switch to store mode; verify the path is within the sandbox root.
